salsa_autologin
===============

Automatic login handler for Telecom Bretagne's Self Administration Low Security Area.

This script works both on wired & wireless variants of SALSA.

Prerequisite:
 * A working OS (Linux prefered, but it works fine on Window$ 7).
 * A valid Python 2.x install.

How to use it:
 * Clone this repo.
 * Edit the file to put your credentials in the '__username' and '__password' fields in the 'asaAutoLogin.py' file, then run it.
 * You can also run the file without any modification: it will interactively asy your credentials.

Beware! This is a quick & dirty piece of code that dates back from January 2013. As I graduated this year, I can't (and won't) validate changes anymore. Furthermore, no warranty is given on whether it will work or not. If you have to fix it, feel free to fix it and fork this repo to push updates.
